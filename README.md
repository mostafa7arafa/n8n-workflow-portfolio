# n8n AI & Automation Workflow Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Mostafa Arafa, and this repository is a curated collection of my work in designing and building advanced automation solutions using n8n.

I specialize in leveraging the power of AI, Large Language Models, and complex logic to create intelligent workflows that solve real-world problems. Each project in this portfolio is a fully-functional, end-to-end solution demonstrating a unique set of skills and architectural patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Skills

This portfolio showcases my experience with a wide range of tools and technologies integrated via n8n:

* **Core Automation:** n8n (Workflows, Sub-Workflows, Webhooks)
* **AI & LangChain:** AI Agents, Tools, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Information Extraction, Text Classification, Persistent Memory
* **AI Models:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, DALL-E), Google Gemini
* **Vector Databases:** Pinecone
* **Cloud & APIs:** Google Workspace (Drive, Sheets, Gmail), Telegram, Calendly, OpenWeatherMap, FireCrawl, Tavily Search
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL

## üìÇ Workflow Showcase

Below is a summary of the projects in this repository. Each one includes a detailed `README.md` in its folder with a full breakdown of its purpose, features, and setup.

| Workflow | Description & Key Features | Core Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Customer Support Email Bot** | An autonomous agent that reads incoming support emails, uses a knowledge base to find answers, and sends replies automatically. | `Gmail`, `LangChain (RAG)`, `Pinecone`, `Gemini` |
| **Automated PDF Invoice Processing** | Watches a Google Drive folder for new PDF invoices, extracts structured data, logs it to a Google Sheet, and emails a summary. | `Google Drive`, `Google Sheets`, `LangChain`, `Gemini`, `OpenAI` |
| **Telegram Bot with Human-in-the-Loop** | An advanced Telegram chatbot where all AI-generated responses must be approved by a human supervisor before being sent to the user. | `Telegram`, `HITL`, `LangChain (Agents)`, `Pinecone`, `Gemini` |
| **Advanced PodMedia Chatbot** | A multi-tool agent for customer support and meeting scheduling, featuring RAG, real-time Calendly API calls, and persistent memory. | `LangChain (Multi-Tool)`, `PostgreSQL`, `Calendly API`, `Pinecone` |
| **Multi-Agent Biography Writer** | A system of three AI agents that autonomously write, evaluate, and revise a creative biography until it meets quality standards, then saves it to Google Docs. | `LangChain (Multi-Agent)`, `Google Docs`, `Autonomous Loop` |
| **AI Weather App (Comparison)** | An exploration of two different architectures (AI Agent vs. Explicit Pipeline) to build a weather-checking chatbot. | `LangChain (Agents)`, `OpenWeatherMap API`, `Design Patterns` |
| **LinkedIn Post & Image Generator** | A dual-agent pipeline that writes a LinkedIn post and generates a matching DALL-E image from a simple topic. | `LangChain (Agents)`, `DALL-E`, `Tavily Search`, `Gemini` |
| **FireCrawl Full-Site Scraper** | Implements an asynchronous polling loop to reliably scrape structured data from every page of an entire website using the FireCrawl API. | `FireCrawl API`, `Web Scraping`, `Asynchronous Polling` |
